# ✅ To‑Do List Application

A clean and practical **To‑Do List Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project focuses on solving a real-life productivity problem by allowing users to **add, complete, delete, and persist tasks** directly in the browser.

This project is part of the **web-development-mini-projects** repository, where each folder represents an independent mini project showcasing core frontend skills.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Everyone needs a simple way to keep track of daily tasks without complexity.

> *“I just want to note my tasks, mark them done, and not lose them when I refresh the page.”*

This application achieves exactly that by using browser **LocalStorage**, ensuring tasks remain saved even after closing or refreshing the browser.

- ✅ Mark tasks as completed (with visual feedback)  
- ❌ Delete tasks easily  
- 💾 Automatic task persistence using **LocalStorage**

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a task and clicks **Add**.
2. A new task element is created dynamically in the DOM.
3. Clicking a task toggles its completed state.
4. Clicking the ❌ icon deletes the task.
5. All tasks are saved in **LocalStorage** and restored on reload.

This mirrors how many real-world task managers work at a basic level.
