# 🎯 Quiz Game Application

An interactive **Quiz Game Application** built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates how core frontend concepts like **DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management** can be used to build a real-world interactive application without any frameworks.

This project lives inside the **web-development-mini-projects** repository, where each folder represents an independent, self-contained project.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Quiz Game solves a common learning and engagement problem:

> *“How can users test their knowledge in a fun, interactive, and distraction-free way directly in the browser?”*

This application presents multiple-choice questions, evaluates answers instantly, tracks the score, and allows users to replay the quiz.

## ✨ Features

- ❓ Multiple-choice quiz questions
- ✅ Instant answer validation (correct / incorrect)
- 🎯 Score tracking throughout the quiz
- 🔄 Replay option after quiz completion
- 🚫 Prevents multiple selections for one question
- ⚡ Lightweight and fast (no libraries, no backend)
- 🧠 Beginner-friendly yet interview-relevant logic

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Application structure  
- **CSS3** – Styling and visual feedback  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Game logic & DOM manipulation

## ⚙️ How the Quiz Works

1. Questions are stored as JavaScript objects.
2. Each question is rendered dynamically in the DOM.
3. When a user selects an answer:
   - The app instantly marks it as correct or incorrect.
   - The correct answer is highlighted.
   - Further input is disabled.
4. The **Next** button loads the next question.
5. At the end, the final score is displayed with a replay option.

This mirrors how real quiz systems handle state and user interaction.
